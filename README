Birdstack
=========

This is the code that powered birdstack.com, a site for creating and sharing
world bird lists. The taxonomy used on the site was from
http://worldbirdnames.org/

We hope that some of the code will be useful as a starting point or source of
examples. But the code is definitely not in a state where it could be
immediately deployed and used. For licensing reasons, we've removed all
third-party libraries and data, some of the operation of the code was very
specific to our production environment, and this code spans over 4 years of
development going back to Rails 1 days.

That said, if you're curious how the site worked, have a look!

Feel free to use this code in your own site if you find it useful. Just make
sure you follow the terms in LICENSE and don't try to represent your site as
being endorsed by Birdstack.

Have fun, and good birding!
